## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_picture_mountain.jpg">

I'm a PhD student in *Theoretical and Computational Biology* in the Erill Lab, at UMBC (USA).
I studied biology (and some mathematics) at the University of Milan (Italy).
I'm a math enthusiast and an amateur jazz piano player.

## Research Interest

I use information theory to study molecular evolution. My research focuses on the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks.


## Publications

* Information Theory of Composite Sequence Motifs: Mutational and Biophysical Determinants of Complex Molecular Recognition
[(Mascolo and Erill, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.11.623117)

* Simultaneous Entry as an Adaptation to Virulence in a Novel Satellite-Helper System Infecting *Streptomyces* Species

* The Transcriptional Regulator CtrA Controls Gene Expression in Alphaproteobacteria Phages: Evidence for a Lytic Deferment Pathway

* Toward a Comparative Systems Biology of the Alphaproteobacterial Cell Cycle - Chapter of "Cell Cycle Regulation and Development in Alphaproteobacteria"

### In preparation

* Mutational Robustness and Evolvability of Transcription Factor Binding Motifs
