<summary><strong>Information Theory of Composite Sequence Motifs</strong></summary>
Through nucleotide conservation, the genomic positions that must be bound by transcription factors can provide information.
The information content (named *Rsequence*) can be measured (in *bits*) and happens to be nearly equal to the amount of information theoretically required for the target location to be accomplishable (a quantity named *Rfrequency*) [(Schneider *et al.*, 1986)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(86)90165-8). I proposed a generalized framework for this fundational theory that can be used to describe the evolution of *composite* sequence motifs of *n* elements [(Mascolo & Erill, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.11.623117).
The classical theory by Schenider can be seen as a special case where *n=1*.
I also show how this framework can be applied to study different aspects of target recognition mediated by molecular complexes (how protein flexibility can co-evolve with spacer variability, the thermodynamic efficiency of different recruitment strategies, and the effect of mutation spectra on the evolvability of different information-encoding strategies).

<summary><strong>FLEMINGO</strong></summary>
I developed a motif discovery tool that can discover *composite motifs* (see [Composite Sequence Motifs](#Information-Theory-of-Composite-Sequence-Motifs)) in biological data (sets of co-regulated promoters) through evolutionary computation.
